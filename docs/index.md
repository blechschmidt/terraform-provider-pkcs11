# pkcs11 Provider

Terraform provider for managing cryptographic objects on PKCS#11 tokens and HSMs.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Connect using a slot ID
provider "pkcs11" {
  module_path = "/usr/lib/pkcs11/yubihsm_pkcs11.so"
  slot_id     = 0
  pin         = var.pkcs11_pin
}

# Connect using a token label
provider "pkcs11" {
  module_path = "/usr/lib/softhsm/libsofthsm2.so"
  token_label = "MyToken"
  pin         = var.pkcs11_pin
}

# Connect using serial number and manufacturer
provider "pkcs11" {
  module_path        = "/usr/lib/pkcs11/yubihsm_pkcs11.so"
  serial_number      = "0123456789"
  token_manufacturer = "Yubico"
  pin                = var.pkcs11_pin
}

# YubiHSM with custom environment
provider "pkcs11" {
  module_path = "/usr/lib/pkcs11/yubihsm_pkcs11.so"
  slot_id     = 0
  pin         = var.pkcs11_pin
  env = {
    "YUBIHSM_PKCS11_CONF" = "/etc/yubihsm_pkcs11.conf"
  }
}

- `module_path` (String) Path to the PKCS#11 shared library module. Can also be set via PKCS11_MODULE_PATH env var.
- `pin` (String, Sensitive) User PIN for the token. Can also be set via PKCS11_PIN env var.
- `serial_number` (String) Serial number of the token to use. Can be combined with token_label, token_manufacturer, and token_model. Mutually exclusive with slot_id. Can also be set via PKCS11_SERIAL_NUMBER env var.
- `slot_id` (Number) Slot ID to use. Mutually exclusive with token_label, serial_number, token_manufacturer, and token_model. Can also be set via PKCS11_SLOT_ID env var.
- `so_pin` (String, Sensitive) Security Officer PIN. Can also be set via PKCS11_SO_PIN env var.
- `token_label` (String) Label of the token to use. Can be combined with serial_number, token_manufacturer, and token_model. Mutually exclusive with slot_id. Can also be set via PKCS11_TOKEN_LABEL env var.
- `token_manufacturer` (String) Manufacturer of the token to use. Can be combined with token_label, serial_number, and token_model. Mutually exclusive with slot_id. Can also be set via PKCS11_TOKEN_MANUFACTURER env var.
- `token_model` (String) Model of the token to use. Can be combined with token_label, serial_number, and token_manufacturer. Mutually exclusive with slot_id. Can also be set via PKCS11_TOKEN_MODEL env var.
